In order to help out writing recipes you of course need to know how you can do that. This recipe is intended to show you how to add a new recipe to the SCTO repository without having to use the command line.

1. Create your own fork of the main recipes repository by clicking "Fork" on the topright. The main repository is [here](https://github.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/DM_secuTrial_recipes).
2. Navigate to your personal fork, which is now on you personal github page.
3. To create a new recipe, first come up with a two to three word description and click "Create new file". (example: create_user_logins)
4. Type the two to three word description (words are connected via underscores) into to box where it says "Name your file..." followed by "/README.md". This will create a directory for your recipe and initialize the README.md file in which you will write the recipe.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and write a useful commit message. (example: initializing new recipe on user login creation)
6.
